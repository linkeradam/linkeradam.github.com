<p>Hello. My name is Adam Linker. I am a student at Jones College Prep. I enjoy drawing, coding, and playing videogames. I have always enjoyed listening to the games I play, even if the game isn't all that great. My favorite games include 'The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim", "Pikmin 2", "Fez", "Minecraft", "Borderlands 2", and "Garry's Mod".I aspire to be a sound engineer, preferably for a company with influence in the gaming communities. I don't like music though, only sound. Ironically, I don't like loud noises, nor anything that drones on and on for hours. I have two dogs, a bassethound and a yellow lab. Recently, one of my friends(a hardcore cat person) has made me like cats alot more than I did a year ago. Before the coding camp at IIT, the only coding knowledge I had was a basic form of "lua" script, which is a language that uses "if - then" statements. </p>
